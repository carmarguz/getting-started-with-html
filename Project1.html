		<h2>How Coding Works</h2>
		<p>Coding happens when a programmer, in a language a computer can understand, tells the PC what to do.</p>
    <h2>Computers are stupid....or are they?</h2>
    <p>Sintax is very important when communicating with a computer. One will receive the wrong information displayed if the request/order is wrong.<br> This can be frustrating at times. However, on the other hand, if the programmer knows how to <em>"talk"</em> correctly to the computer...<b>the computer will do anything the programmer wants!</b></p>
    <h2>It's not easy to remember everything</h2>
    <p>One does not necessarily need to remember everything. There are plenty of online resources to research any particular tag. </p>
<h2>Basic HTML vocabulary</h2>
	<p>It is important to feel comfortable with the jargon</p>
		<ul>
      <li><b>Tag</b></li>
			<p>An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets {}</p>
			<p>Most tags have an opening tag ( "<em>" for example) and a closing tag ( </em>).
			<p>There are some tags, called "void" tags, which do not require closing ( like the <br> tag.)</p>
      <li><b>Element</b></li>
      <p>Everything within a set of opening and closing tags <em>is</em> considered an Element.</P>
    <li><b>Attribute</b></li>
    <p>the property of an HTML element is called an attribute.</p>
